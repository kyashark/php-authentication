# PHP Authentication System

- This PHP Authentication System allows users to register, log in, and log out securely. 

- It uses a MySQL database to store user credentials and employs secure password handling with **password_hash** and **password_verify**. 

- **Prepared statements** are used to prevent SQL injection, and basic input validation is implemented for username, email, and password fields. 

- The system also manages user sessions to keep users logged in after authentication and users can log out, destroying their session.
